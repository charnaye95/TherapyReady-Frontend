## Technologies used
React.js, JSX, JavaScript, CSS, HTML

## Description
A one-stop site that makes it easy to find the therapist you are looking for. When someone is seeking therapy, you don't want anything to dissuade them during the search. As of right now, I have yet to see a site that provides the essentials a therapy-seeker is looking for and TherapyReady is my in-progress answer for that.

## Stretch Goals / Major Hurdles 

<ul>
<li>A stretch goal would be to add user authentication on the front end with signup and login functionality.</li>
<li>A stretch goal would be to media query the CSS for other devices and screen sizes.</li>
<li>A stretch goal is to add a saved page or component and for whichever clinics or therapists a user likes or favorites, it would add to the saved section.</li>
<li>A major hurdle was staying in the React "frame of mind". I withstood it a lot better than my previous project and could see a major difference in my confidence level.</li>
<li>A major hurdle was remembering syntax when dealing with JSX, but once you get going, its like muscle memory.</li>
</ul>
